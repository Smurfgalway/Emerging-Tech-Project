# Emerging-Tech-Project
This is my repository for my project in my Emerging Technologies module in college. 
The brief is as follows:
## brief overview
In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. You should use tensorflow and flask to do this. Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.
## Instructions given
1. Create a git repository with a README.md and an appropriate gitignore file. The README should explain who you are, why you created the application, how you created it, how to download and run it, and summarise any references you have used.
2. In the repository, create a web application that serves a HTML page as the root resource. The page should contain an input where the user can upload (or draw) an image containing a digit, and an area to display the image and the digit.
3. Add a route to your application that accepts requests containing a user input image and responds with the digit.
4. Connect the HTML page to the route using AJAX.

# How to Run
1. Download zip file from my github.
2. Unzip the folder in your prefered workspace.
3. Open some form of command line be it [command prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840) on microsoft devices, [cmdr](http://cmder.net/), [Terminal](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/) on apple devices, or [anaconda prompt](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
4. In your instance of command line navigate into the directory where you unzipped the folder.
5. To run the command "python Main.py" it will launch the html page in your browser.
6. The html page will run on your local host  http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
